	  Wille Maxwell was raised in a housing project in Paterson, New Jersey, and is of Haitian descent.[5][6]
He began taking interest in music in 2013. Initially starting off as only a rapper, he later decided to start singing as well because he "wanted to do something different." He was nicknamed "Fetty" (slang for money) as he was known for making money. "Wap" was added to the end of the name to perform under in tribute to his favorite rapper Gucci Mane.[7][8][9]

Wap's first single was released in early 2014 titled "Trap Queen". He made the song in February 2014, but it did not start to get recognition until mid-November 2014, and since it has become a platinum record and has over 80 million plays on SoundCloud. His debut mixtape, Fetty Wap: The Mixtape was originally set for release in February 2015 but was delayed because he continued making new songs.[10] On June 29, 2015, Wap released his second single "679". The song's accompanying music video premiered on Youtube in May.[11]

When he was a child, Wap developed glaucoma in both eyes. He revealed in a 2015 interview that doctors were unable to save his left eye and instead fitted him with an ocular prosthesis.[12]</p>
